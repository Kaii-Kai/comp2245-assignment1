		<h2>Kyra Lee</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Kyra Lee, I'm currently a 19 year old second year student at the UWI FiveIslands Campus studying Computer Science. I chose this field because I liked IT in highschool and unfortunately I decided that I didn't want to become a doctor anymore. My reasoning was based on thinking that I wouldn't make it, but here I am choosing an even harder degree to pursue, hopefully all goes well and I can find a job in cybersecurity.</p>
